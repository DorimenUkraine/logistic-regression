# logistic-regression
Build a model for logistic regression.
This model creates a dataset as follow :

(1, x1), (1, x2), ..., (1, xn)

It uses the cross-entropy loss function that we need to minimize with gradient descent algorithm.

We use dot product between coefficients and x values.

Once we get our coefficients approximation, we plot the cumulative distribution function to get probabilities.
